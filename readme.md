# Dark Mode for Quantic Learning Portal

This is a simple Chrome/Edge extension that works on the Quantic Learning Portal for the MBA/EMBA students.

## Motivations
Studying is hard on the portal... especially if you're used to dark mode.
In between studying Macroeconomics and US Fiscal policies, I figured I could make my life simple by creating this extension. <br>
To be honest, I didn't really make it as an extension to begin with... just some JS to inject into the Angular page. Eventually, I figured some others might find use of it, so I turned it into an extension.

## Functionality
![alt text for screen readers](/screenshots/interface.jpg "The UI on clicking the icon") <br>
As it is evident on the screen, the UI functions pretty simply:
1. Users are given the option to invert the colors (Dark mode baby!)
2. They can adjust the brightness (sometimes, you don't really need dark mode)
3. Color shifts to get rid of the annoying inversions
4. Saturation drops for the moody soul
<br> <br>
In addition to the above, I've also added some quick short cuts to my fav moods: Study, Off Color & B&W.

## Code Quality
Lol.
